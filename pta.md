Prime Time Agian
 input 24 2
 then we have to find out how many prime numbers are at the same index of each half of 24 i.e 12
 eg :
 24 2
 1   2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
  here (5,17), (7,19), and (11,23) are prime time pairs as they are at same indices 
  therefore the output should be 3
